# C++ Data Structures & Algorithms
This project contains implementations for many common data structure and algorithms contained in the C++ Standard Library.

This is an intellectual exercise and should obviously **not** be used as a subtitute for the actual C++ Standard Library.

Instead of replicating all of the functionality of the interfaces contained in the C++ Standard Library, I have mostly added methods on an as-needed basis. If a particular method doesn't exist, it hasn't been required (yet).

## How to Run
The project includes Visual Studio project files.

The `Tests` project contains unit tests written using the Microsoft C++ Unit Test Framework, which verify all of the functionality conatined in the `Algorithms` and `DataStrctures` projects.
